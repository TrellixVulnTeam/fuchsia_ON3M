// ld::abi::Module holds all the information about an ELF module that's still
// relevant at runtime after it's been loaded and dynamically linked.  This is
// enough for basic dl_iterate_phdr and dlsym implementations and the like to
// interrogate the iniital-exec set of modules.
//
// This type is defined in the ld::abi namespace because these layouts form
// part of the quasi-public, quasi-stable "passive" data ABI between startup or
// OOP dynamic linking and other runtime dynamic linking support code that
// might live in libc.so or libdl.so.  Note that this brings a few toolkit API
// types, which are not otherwise presumed ABI stable nor even public outside a
// single module, into the ld::abi regime for quasi-public, quasi-stable ABI.
//
// The leading portion of ld::abi::Module matches the long-standing de facto
// standard ABI layout of `struct link_map` from SVR4.  The doubly-linked list
// structure of `link_map::l_prev` and `link_map::l_next` is maintained to
// navigate the initial-exec set in load order (which is also symbol resolution
// precedence order for standard initial-exec symbol resolution).  The pointers
// are actually to ld::abi::Module structures with leading `link_map` portions.

namespace ld::abi {

struct Module {
  // This is known to be the first member in the struct layout.  It forms the
  // old de facto ABI from SVR4 (traditionally `struct link_map` in <link.h>)
  // for enumerating the modules and their load/symbol-resolution order through
  // its doubly-linked list structure.  It also holds the load bias (.addr); a
  // pointer (.name) to the NUL-terminated DT_SONAME (or other) name string by
  // which the module was loaded; and a pointer (.ld) to the absolute runtime
  // address of the PT_DYNAMIC segment (aka .dynamic section) in this module's
  // load image.  The .dynamic data has already been parsed and validated so
  // it's safe to rely on the DT_NULL terminator being found by iteration.
  //
  // It's traditional for dynamic linkers to use this well-known format as the
  // leading portion of their own internal data structure.  For example, some
  // users may assume that the void* value returned by `dlopen` is in fact the
  // `struct link_map*` for the module just fetched.  This is not good practice
  // and no standard or documentation has ever made guarantees avoid the void*
  // values used in <dlfcn.h> interfaces being used in any such ways.  But it
  // makes sense that we follow suit here.  The `struct link_map` list serves
  // as the ld::abi::Module list as well.
  Elf::LinkMap link_map;

  // The rest of the ld::abi::Module layout is a distinct extension that does
  // not overlap with any historical ABI.  (Traditional uses that have longer
  // data structures prefixed with `struct link_map` are all private formats.)
  //
  // However, it does form the core of the quasi-public, quasi-stable ABI for
  // ld.so; see <lib/ld/abi.h> for full details on the ABI stability model.

  // This module's whole-page load image occupies the absolute virtual address
  // range [vaddr_start, vaddr_end).  The vaddr_start value is most often
  // redundant with link_map.addr (the load bias), but is not required to be.

  // This points to the module's program headers in some read-only memory,
  // usually in its own load image as located by PT_PHDR.  (The span may be
  // empty if the program headers are not visible in memory, and this won't
  // always prevent a module from being loaded.  But any such unusual module
  // with that limitation may have unexpected behavior due to their metadata
  // pointers such as PT_GNU_EH_FRAME not being found at runtime.)
