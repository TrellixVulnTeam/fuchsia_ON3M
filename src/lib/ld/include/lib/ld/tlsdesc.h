// These declarations relate to the TLSDESC runtime ABI.  While the particular
// ABI details are specific to each machine, they all fit a common pattern.
//
// The R_*_TLSDESC relocation type directs dynamic linking to fill in a special
// pair of adjacent GOT slots.  The first slot is unfilled at link time and
// gets the PC of a special function provided by the dynamic linking runtime.
// For each TLS reference, the compiler generates an indirect call via this GOT
// slot.  The compiler also passes that address in the GOT to that function.
//
// This is a normal indirect call at the machine level.  However, it uses its
// own bespoke calling convention specified in the psABI for each machine
// rather than the standard C/C++ calling convention.  The convention for each
// machine is similar: the use of the return address register and/or stack is
// normal; one or two registers are designated for the argument (GOT address),
// return value, and scratch; all other registers are preserved by the call,
// except the condition codes.  The return value is usually either an address
// or an offset from the psABI-specified thread-pointer register.
//
// This makes the impact of the runtime call on code generation very minimal.
// The runtime implementation both can refer to the value stored in the GOT
// slot by dynamic linking and can in theory dynamically update both slots to
// lazily redirect to a different runtime entry point and argument data.
//
// The relocation's symbol and addend are meant to apply to the second GOT slot
// of the pair.  (For DT_REL format, the addend is stored in place there.)
// When dynamic linking chooses an entry point to store into the first GOT slot
// it also chooses the value to store in the second slot, which is some kind of
// offset or address that includes the addend and symbol value calculations.
